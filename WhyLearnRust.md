# Why Learn Rust
Rust a relatively young language which started being made in 2006 and was officially released to the public in 2012 especially compared to Python which was made in 1991. This means that it is still not that a widely used language and therefore it seems sort of pointless to learn. However, it was a plethora of benefits.

One of these and arguably most importantly is its performance, Rust compiles to native code and has a minimal runtime, making it very fast and efficient. This is achieved by making rust a statically typed language allowing it to perform efficiency optimizations during compilation more so than dynamically typed languages. Furthermore, by being compiled to native code it provides low-level control over hardware resources such as threads, interrupts, and memory. 

Another benefit is memory and more specifically memory safety via preventing common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows via the use of Rust's type system and ownership mode. Something C and C++ do not possess. Rust's type system ensures that all variables are properly initialised. Rust's ownership model ensures that each piece of memory has a single owner, and that ownership can be transferred between variables using rules enforced by the compiler ensuring no memory leaks.

# What level do you need to be at
Though it would obviously help having coding experience Rust is honestly a very simple language to learn and could be your first language, this would mean you would not become overly reliant on things specific to languages such as becoming overly reliant on lists, which happened to me, due to me start started learning coding via. python.

If this is the case, I recommend you learn some basics such as data types as well as binary and understanding how bits translate into the amount of data, due to variables having to be declared when created. I personally believe that the best way to catch up on this is through watching MrBrownCS's videos on AQA GCSE'S paper 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBTatD-BCjw&list=PL04uZ7242_M4BarR18V22PfEGkMzxR2yX&index=1
As it allows one to catch up on data types and other cs basics before one learns to code.

However, I do not recommend this personally as I genuinely just believe that rust is very specific in what it can do and therefore to get someone into coding, it fails in the regard. Compared to languages like python which for someone learning to code for the first time you can easily teach them to make a quick game rust doesnâ€™t as easily allow for this. Furthermore, having to define data types can be seen as boring for someone just starting off. 

Therefore, I personally recommend you learn how to code in one other language first specifically python due to its ease of use and versatility. This can be done in many ways but the way I recommend is through freeCodeCamp.org's entire course on it

# To Start Learning Rust
I personally the best way to learn a programming language is through using it and making mistakes. Consequently, I recommend working on small projects and expanding from there. This allows you to get more comfortable with the syntax of the language as you learn it however a basis is required to start you of, and this is where I recommend reading the Rust Basic's book https://www.rust-lang.org/learn. This is because it teaches you rust from first principles and whilst you are reading it completing some tasks such as adding two numbers and basic conditions but as you should start off with in any programming language printing "hello world" into the console.

Tutorials that allow you to follow along are useful however if they do not also teach you understanding of what you are doing you are not really learning but just copying someone else mindlessly. Though, if you keep this into account whilst you are watching the tutorials, they can be the best way to learn a language. The one I recommend the most is the rust programming tutorial by Tech With Tim due to him not only going through small programs such as adding two numbers but also explains every step he is doing and why he is doing it:

Once you have learnt the basics of Rust, I recommend you use it in a more complex way, this forces you to not only stretch your thinking and understanding of the way rust works but also forces you to research different libraries rust is able to use. Furthermore, it forces you to learn how rust works with other languages as one of its main benefits is being able to be compiled and turned into a dynamic library allowing languages such as JavaScript being able to access it. One is never fully knowledgeable especially when it comes to computer science but if you are able to do this it allows you to solve through research any problems you could face.

# Evaluation
Some might say that though Rust is easy to learn it fills such a specific niche case that people genuinely do not believe it is worth learning. This is for many reasons, but people think that, most importantly, there are other much more established languages that are used far more often in industry in a similar way. An example is C++. Both are high-performance, systems-level languages that allow for low-level memory manipulation and efficient code execution.

They would be wrong; Rust is the one of the fastest growing languages and most companies are looking to replacing all their C++ code with it due to the benefits Rust brings such as security vulnerabilities as well as memory efficiency. Furthermore, this makes it even more valuable to learn as due to Rust being such a young language you can be leading the field and the competition for jobs in rust is smaller. This means that there is much money to be made.

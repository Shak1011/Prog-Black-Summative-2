## Entry 1 - 03/03/2023
For this assignment I have decided I want to familiarise myself with app development something in which I have very little experience in. Therefore I have spearheaded a project to create a ranking app for all badminton players in durham with the goal to give each player an everchanging rating depending on your wins and loses. 

To complete this task I have decided that I need to branch out and learn another language especially one that has me thinking more about memory management as coding in python, the language I have used the most, allowed me not to even have to think about it. Consequently, I have decided to learn rust for the back end due to it being fast, memory-efficient, and the fact it easily interacts with other languages. For the front end I will most likely use javascript.

To start learning Rust I have decided to consult many youtube videos to teach me the very basics. 

### Objectives
* Finalise design of badminton ranking app 
* Divide work equally among the group giving us all set goals
* Continue learning the basics of rust
* Learn an efficient way to connect the front-end JavaScript to the back-end Rust

## Entry 2 - 03/03/2023
This week we finalized a group and plan. I will be developing the Log In and Register screen in HTML. Set up a serving using Node Js. And use Rust to create a Hashing Algorithm as well as a database and be able to input new users into the databases.
In terms of the learning of rust I have learnt how to do the basics such a setting up a rust file using cargo build, As well as learning how variables and data types work as well as inputs and arthmetics and type casting

## Entry 3 - 10/03/2023
This week i took a break from rust and spent it doing the html and nodejs work.


## Entry 4 - 17/03/2023
This week i finished learning the basics of rust so that i can start coding, This involed me learning about conditios and how functions work in rust. Furthermore I delved deeper into how memory managment works in Rust

## Entry 5 - 24/03/2023
This week I learnt how to set up and use databases in Rust and finished setting up a server on Node Js.


## Entry 7 - 07/04/2023
Finished hashing algorithm

## Entry 8 - 14/04/2023
Learning how to intergrate rust onto the front end and run rust code in node js

## Entry 9 - 22/04/2023
Completion of what i need to do

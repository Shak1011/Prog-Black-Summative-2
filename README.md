## Entry 1 - 03/03/2023
For this assignment I have decided I want to familiarise myself with app development something in which I have very little experience in. herefore I have spearheaded a project to create a ranking app for all badminton players in durham with the goal to give each player an everchanging rating depending on your wins and loses. 

To complete this task I have decided that I need to branch out and learn another language especially one that has me thinking more about memory management as coding in python, the language I have used the most, allowed me not to even have to think about it. Consequently, I have decided to learn rust for the back end due to it being fast, memory-efficient, and the fact it easily interacts with other languages. For the front end I will most likely use javascript.

To start learning Rust I have decided to consult many youtube videos to teach me the very basics. 

###Objectives
* Finalise design of badminton ranking app 
* Divide work equally among the group giving us all set goals
* Continue learning the basics of rust
* Learn an efficient way to connect the front-end JavaScript to the back-end Rust
